Title & Purpose ::: Classify whether a tweet is disaster or non disaster
Feature ::: 
a) Data collection and preprocessing
b) Toeknization of data
c) Vectorization of tokenized data
d) Conversion to embeddings
e) Model implementation - Naive Bayes,TF-IDF,LSTM,Conv-1D,GRU,BERT
f) Model evaluation and comparison

Usage ::: Identifying whether a tweet is disaster or not. The classification models can be sued for other binary 
          and multi class classification requirements
Tools Used ::: TensorFlow,Keras,Naive Bayes,TF-IDF,LSTM,Conv-1D,GRU,BERT,Python
